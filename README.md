# CUI Toolkit for Dos

A character user interface toolkit for building applications on now obsolete DOS. This was a personal project written when I was doing my masters degree.

I had good knowledge of C but did not know about C++, classess etc. Most of the assembly code is based on examples from a book I don't remember now. It was excellent and I had fun hacking around with C and assembly coding.

Some interesting things I learnt

- Loading custom fonts on the command line interface
- Changing the number of rows and columns
- Creating boxes with Ascii characters
- Basics of Object oriented programming and header files
- The structure of BMP file and reading it

## Issues

Some of the code is probably still buggy with the linked list and pointers. Unnecessary or bad comments. Used a lot of bit flags and many of the codes used do not have good names or comments.
